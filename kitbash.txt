This is just a file to document my kitbashing attempts. By that I mean to combine one, two or more sprites into a new one.

BigObs (*.png)
heavy_stubber_light = handheld_heavy_stubber + heavy_stubber
sentinel multilaser = chimera_multilaser
hellpistol = 299 + hellpistol + hellpistol_disconnected
hellpistol_purple = reshaded hellpistol
light_bolter_ultra = 339 + bolter_locke
light_boltpistol_ultra = 341 + boltpistol_deaz
exitus_purple = autogun + SNIPER
Exitus_bullets_* = S1
airstrike_vox = xcom1 motion sensor
airstrike_mission = B1
grenade_launcher_*_drum = grenade_launcher_frag_drum
null_sentinel_backpack_missile_with_ammo = null_sentinel_backpack_missile

HandObs (*.png)
handob_handheld_heavy_stubber_ig = handob_handheld_heavy_stubber + handob_heavy_stubber
handobs_chainsword_guardofficer = 632.png inspired by Leflair's Guard Officer Chainsword
handobs_exitus = SNIPER
hellpistol and hellpistol_blue are original assets from the 40k basemod
handobs_chainsword_guardofficer = 632

FloorObs (*.png)
floorob_handheld_heavy_stubber_ig = floorob_handheld_heavy_stubber + floorob_heavy_stubber
floorob_chainsword_guardofficer = rotated handobs_chainsword_guardofficer

Spicons (*.png)
spicon_vox_buff = spicon_vox

UnitSprites (*.png)
stormtrooper_officer_carapace = stormtrooper_carapace + officer_carapace
stormtrooper_medic_carapace = stormtrooper_carapace + medic_carapace

tempestus_scion_officer = (Advanced Carapace for Others) tempestus_scion_officer +  tempestus_scion
tempestus_scion_medic was directly taken from Advanced Carapace for Others


Officer_Carapace_Female = (Advanced Carapace for Others) Officer_Carapace_Female + Officer_Carapace_Inv/man_0f0.gif + Stormtrooper_Carapace_Inv/man_0f0.gif
Officer_Carapace_Male = (Advanced Carapace for Others) Officer_Carapace_Male + Officer_Carapace_Inv/man_0m0.gif + Stormtrooper_Carapace_Inv/man_0m0.gif

Veteran_Medic_Carapace_Female = Medic_Female + Stormtrooper_Female
Veteran_Medic_Carapace_Male = Medic_Male + Stormtrooper_Male

Scion_Officer_Carapace_Female = (Advanced Carapace for Others) Officer_Carapace_Female
Scion_Officer_Carapace_Male = (Advanced Carapace for Others) Officer_Carapace_Male
