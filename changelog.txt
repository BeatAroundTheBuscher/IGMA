v0.1
####

Initial release

######
v0.281
######

- added voice overs for missing units (IG medics, ...)
v0.28 is linked to 40k version 28 => 0.28

######
v0.282
######

- added graphics for IG variant of the handheld heavy stubber, veteran officers, hellpistol, multilaser sentinel
- added armors explicit for the veteran officer
- added ufopaedia entries for Carapace/Medic and Adv. Officer Carapace
- added some personal pet peeve fixes. The most important one is that the Lascannon of the Sentinel has now a power of 150 instead of 100. 200 is too much because it's a very mobile unit and would obsolete the Mounted Lascannon (which I have never used so far; I'd rather have four guardsman with Hellhammers but I disgress..)
